"""WP0 spike: check a LiteLLM pin against known-bad PyPI releases.

Usage: python3 check.py [version ...]   (defaults to the vendor-stated safe pin, 1.106.2)
Exit 1 if any checked version is listed as compromised or is missing on PyPI.
Advisory data is hand-entered from public reports dated 2026-03-24 and 2026-10-21; re-verify
against LiteLLM's own incident post before relying on it.
